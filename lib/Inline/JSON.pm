=head1 NAME

Inline::JSON - Embed JSON data structures directly into your Perl code

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.0.2';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Inline::JSON;

    my $json = json: {
        "name":   "Awesome",
        "title":  "Mr.",
        "skills": [
            "Nunchucking",
            "Bowhunting",
            "Computer Hacking",
            "Being Awesome",
        ]
    };

    use Data::Dumper;
    print Dumper($json);

Yields the output like:

    $VAR1 = {
               'name' => 'Awesome',
               'title' => 'Mr.',
               'skills' => [
                             "Nunchucking",
                             "Bowhunting",
                             "Computer Hacking",
                             "Being Awesome",
                           ]
            };

You can also specify array references as the top-level JSON element, by using
brackets instead of curly braces:

    my $list_of_hashrefs = json: [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "one",
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "two",
        },
        {
            "id": "3",
            "name": "three",
        },
    ];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

JSON is a data specification format used for interoperability with a
multitude of languages. Sometimes you have a chunk of YAML that you need to
turn into a Perl data structure.  This module allows you to specify that
code inline within your perl program.  It is syntactic sugar on top of
the existing JSON module, you could just as easily say:

   my $json = JSON->new->decode('{
       // JSON code here
   }');

Which is what the module is doing internally, it just looks nicer.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module uses simple balanced brackets or curly braces matching to
determine the end of the chunk of JSON code, and does not pay attention to
quotes.  If you have curly braces embedded in the strings in your JSON code,
it can cause the filter to misinterpret the end of the JSON.

If you'd like to see what the filtered perl code looks like after the source
filter has been run on it, set the variable $Inline::JSON::DEBUG to a true
value.
